## 🧠 What is Mizkolog?

**Mizkolog** is an AI-powered web application designed to provide **temperament-based guidance, companionship, and self-understanding**.

Unlike generic AI chatbots or advice platforms, Mizkolog begins with a **scientifically grounded temperament assessment**, ensuring that every interaction is personalized from the very first step.

Users do not talk to a generic assistant.  
They interact with an AI that understands **who they are**, how they think, and how they emotionally process the world.

## 🔬 Scientific Foundation — 9 Types of Temperament

Mizkolog is built on the **Nine Types of Temperament Model (9 Tip Mizaç Modeli)**, a scientifically based framework focused on:

- Core temperament structures
- Behavioral tendencies
- Emotional response patterns
- Decision-making styles

Based on this model:
- Each user completes a temperament assessment
- Users are matched with a **guidance-style AI** aligned with their temperament
- Every temperament type has its **own AI personality and communication style**

---

## 🤖 Personalized AI Guidance Experience

Mizkolog offers a **deeply personal AI guidance experience**, not a one-size-fits-all chatbot.

### Key Characteristics
- Users can choose from **9 different AI guides**, each representing a temperament type
- The AI adapts its tone, depth, and guidance style to the user
- Conversations feel closer, safer, and more natural

This creates an experience that feels more like **a personal guide or companion** rather than an AI assistant.
